## 🔥 Install & Execute

1. Clone the [repo](https://gitlab.com/md88/walbet/front-reac-native)
2. Open the cloned repo
3. Run `npm i` to install the dependecies
4. Run `npm start` or `expo start` to start the app
5. To open the project directly in android execute `npm run android` or `expo start --android`
6. To open the project directly in ios execute `npm run ios` or `expo start --ios`
7. To open the project directly in web execute `expo start --web`

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache

```

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.
